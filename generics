What is Generics in Dart?
Generics in Dart allow you to create flexible, reusable, and type-safe classes, methods, and functions by using placeholder types instead of specific types like int, String, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Why Use Generics?
Type Safety â€“ Prevents runtime type errors.
Code Reusability â€“ Write a single class/method that works for multiple types.
Performance â€“ Avoids unnecessary type conversions and checks.
