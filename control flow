What is Control Flow?
Control flow refers to the order in which statements, expressions, and functions are executed in a program. It determines how the program makes decisions and repeats actions based on conditions.

What is Control Flow Used For?
Decision Making – Execute different code blocks based on conditions (if, else, switch).
Looping – Repeat actions multiple times (for, while, do-while).
Jumping Between Code – Alter the flow using statements like break, continue, and return.

Control Flow Statements in Dart
1. Conditional Statements (Decision Making)
a) if, else if, and else Statements
Used to execute different code blocks based on conditions.

b) if-else if-else (Multiple Conditions)

c) switch Statement
Used when there are multiple possible values for a variable.

2. Looping Statements (Repetition)
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

a) for Loop (Used when the number of iterations is known)

b) while Loop (Used when the number of iterations is unknown)

c) do-while Loop (Executes at least once before checking the condition)

3. Jump Statements (Altering Flow)
a) break (Exit a loop or switch statement)

b) continue (Skip current iteration and move to the next)

c) return (Exit a function and return a value)

Key Points
Conditional statements (if, else, switch) help make decisions.
Loops (for, while, do-while) repeat code based on conditions.
Jump statements (break, continue, return) alter execution flow.
