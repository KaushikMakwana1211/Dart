What is a Function?
A function in Dart is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps organize code, avoid repetition, and improve readability.

What are Functions Used For?
Code Reusability – Write once, use multiple times.
Modularity – Break complex code into smaller, manageable parts.
Readability – Makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.
Efficiency – Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.


Types of Functions in Dart
1. Basic Function (Without Parameters & Return Value)

2. Function with Parameters
Used to pass values to a function.

3. Function with Return Value
Returns a value after execution.

4. Arrow Function (Short Syntax)
For simple functions, use => instead of { return ... }.

5. Named Parameters (Optional & Default Values)
Use {} to define named parameters.

6. Anonymous Function (Lambda Expression)
A function without a name, used for short operations.

7. Higher-Order Function (Passing Function as Parameter)
Functions can accept other functions as arguments.
