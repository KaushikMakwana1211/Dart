What is a Data Type?
A data type defines the kind of value a variable can store. It ensures that variables hold only valid values and helps the compiler understand how to handle the data.

What are Data Types Used For?
Memory Management – Helps allocate the right amount of memory.
Type Safety – Prevents errors by ensuring variables store correct types of values.
Code Readability – Makes the code easier to understand by specifying what kind of data is being used.
Performance Optimization – Optimizes how data is processed and stored.

1. Numbers (int, double)
Used for storing numeric values.

int → Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 1000)
double → Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -7.5, 0.99)

2. Strings (String)
Used to store text (characters).

3. Booleans (bool)
Used to store true or false values.

Key Points
Dart supports type inference, so var can automatically detect the type.
Use final and const for immutable values.
dynamic allows flexibility but should be used cautiously.
