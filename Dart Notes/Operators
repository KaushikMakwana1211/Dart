What is an Operator?
An operator in Dart is a special symbol used to perform operations on variables and values. Operators allow you to manipulate data, perform calculations, and make logical decisions in your program.

What are Operators Used For?
Arithmetic Operations – Perform mathematical calculations.
Comparison – Compare values to make decisions.
Logical Operations – Combine multiple conditions.
Assignment – Assign values to variables.
Bitwise Operations – Manipulate binary representations of numbers.

Types of Operators in Dart
1. Arithmetic Operators (Used for mathematical operations)
Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	5 + 3 → 8
-	Subtraction	10 - 4 → 6
*	Multiplication	2 * 3 → 6
/	Division (returns double)	10 / 2 → 5.0
~/	Integer Division	10 ~/ 3 → 3
%	Modulus (remainder)	10 % 3 → 1

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators (Used to compare values)
Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	5 == 5 → true
!=	Not equal to	5 != 3 → true
>	Greater than	10 > 5 → true
<	Less than	3 < 5 → true
>=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 5 → true
<=	Less than or equal to	4 <= 5 → true

3. Logical Operators (Used for Boolean logic)
Operator	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND	(true && false) → false
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!(true) → false

4. Assignment Operators (Used to assign values to variables)
Operator	Description	Example
=	Assign	a = 10
+=	Add and assign	a += 5 (same as a = a + 5)
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= 2 (same as a = a - 2)
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= 3 (same as a = a * 3)
/=	Divide and assign	a /= 2 (same as a = a / 2)
~/=	Integer divide and assign	a ~/= 3

5. Bitwise Operators (Used for bitwise operations)
Operator	Description	Example
&	Bitwise AND	5 & 3 → 1
`	`	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR	5 ^ 3 → 6
~	Bitwise Complement	~5 → -6
<<	Left shift	5 << 1 → 10
>>	Right shift	5 >> 1 → 2

6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator (Short form of if-else)

7. Null-aware Operators (Handle null values safely)
Operator	Description	Example
??	If null, use right-hand value	a ?? 10
??=	Assign value only if null	a ??= 5
?.	Safe access to properties	obj?.method()
