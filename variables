What is a Variable?
A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. It allows you to store, modify, and retrieve data during the execution of a program.

What are Variables Used For?
Variables are used to:

Store Data – Hold different types of data like numbers, text, and objects.
Reuse Values – Assign a value once and use it multiple times in a program.
Improve Readability – Give meaningful names to values instead of using raw data.
Manipulate Data – Perform calculations and process information dynamically.

Variables in Dart
In Dart, you declare a variable using var, final, const, or specific data types like int, double, String, etc.

Key Points:
var – Type is inferred automatically.
int, double, String, bool – Explicitly define the type.
final – Can be assigned only once but determined at runtime.
const – A compile-time constant (fixed at compile-time).

var - jo tame pehla j define karyo hoy to e j data type chale ane ane modify kari sakay che ane jo tame pachi define karyo hoy to koi pan data type chale
coast - aa data type ne pehle thi j define karvo pade che ane ane modify kari sakato nathi
final - jo tame pehla j define karyo hoy to e j data type chale ane ane modify kari sakato nathi
dynamic - koi pan data type chale ane game tyre modefy kari sakay che
